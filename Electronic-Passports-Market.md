Electronic passports, or e-passports, utilize embedded microchips that store personal data and biometric information, enhancing identity verification and border security. The global market value of electronic passports was estimated at approximately $20 billion in 2023, and with the swift adoption of electronic identification solutions across various nations, the market is set for substantial expansion.</p><p>Advancements in technology, particularly in biometric systems, are expected to further propel market growth. The integration of advanced encryption technologies and the ongoing shift towards a more contactless travel experience have encouraged governments to upgrade their passport solutions. By 2024, the electronic passports market is projected to reach around $25 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 7.5% through to 2032.</p><p>In terms of market segmentation, the government sector remains the primary contributor to the e-passport market, accounting for a substantial share. The increasing adoption of biometric infrastructures at airports and border control points is facilitating the issuance and verification of electronic passports. By 2025, it is estimated that the government sector alone will generate revenues exceeding $30 billion.</p><p>The shift towards more efficient travel processes, driven by the increase of frequent travelers and ongoing digitization across various sectors, particularly tourism and business travel, will further bolster market growth.
